They provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying structure. This allows for memory-efficient processing of large datasets and seamless iteration over various data types."

    "- **Memory Efficiency:** Iterators process elements one at a time, which is ideal for working with large datasets as they do not require loading the entire collection into memory.\n",
    "- **Lazy Evaluation:** Elements are generated on-the-fly, allowing for efficient computation and reduced resource usage.\n",
    "- **Seamless Looping:** Iterators provide a consistent interface for looping over different data structures (lists, files, etc.).\n",
    "- **Improved Performance:** By avoiding unnecessary computations and memory allocations, iterators can make code faster and more responsive.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Iterators can be chained and combined to create complex data processing pipelines."
