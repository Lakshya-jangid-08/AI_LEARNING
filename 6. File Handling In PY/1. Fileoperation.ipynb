    "## File Operations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "File operations are essential for reading from and writing to files in Python. They allow you to store data persistently, process large datasets, and interact with external resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common File Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Opening a File:**  \n",
    "    Use the `open()` function to open a file. You can specify the mode, such as `'r'` for reading, `'w'` for writing, or `'a'` for appending.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reading from a File:**  \n",
    "    Use methods like `.read()`, `.readline()`, or `.readlines()` to read data.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Writing to a File:**  \n",
    "    Open the file in write (`'w'`) or append (`'a'`) mode and use `.write()` or `.writelines()`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Closing a File:**  \n",
    "    Always close the file after operations to free resources.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using `with` Statement:**  \n",
    "    The `with` statement automatically closes the file, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "            content = file.read()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description           |\n",
    "|------|-----------------------|\n",
    "| `'r'`  | Read (default)         |\n",
    "| `'w'`  | Write (overwrite)      |\n",
    "| `'a'`  | Append                 |\n",
    "| `'b'`  | Binary mode            |\n",
    "| `'+'`  | Read and write         |\n",
    "\n",
    "File operations are fundamental for data processing and automation tasks in Python."
